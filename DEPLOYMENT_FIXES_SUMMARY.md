# 3CX Analytics - Vercel Deployment Architecture Fixes

## Problem Summary
The application was previously deployed as two separate Vercel projects:
- Frontend: `https://3-cx-analytics-front.vercel.app/`
- Backend: `https://3-cx-analytics-back-blush.vercel.app/`

This caused the frontend to be unable to access API endpoints due to CORS and routing issues.

## Solution Implemented
Restructured the project as a **unified monorepo deployment** that serves both frontend and backend from a single Vercel project.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Root-Level Configuration Files
- **`vercel.json`** - Main Vercel configuration for monorepo deployment
- **`package.json`** - Root package.json with build orchestration
- **`.vercelignore`** - Deployment optimization
- **`.env.example`** - Environment variables template

### 2. Updated Server Configuration
- **`server/vercel.json`** - Simplified server-specific config
- **`server/package.json`** - Updated build scripts
- **`server/index.cjs`** - Fixed static file serving paths

### 3. Updated Client Configuration
- **`client/vite.config.ts`** - Optimized build output structure

### 4. Documentation
- **`MONOREPO_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Complete deployment guide
- **`DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary

## Key Architecture Changes

### Routing Structure
```
/ → React app (SPA)
/api/* → Express.js API endpoints
/health → Health check endpoint
/assets/* → Static assets (cached)
/static/* → Static assets (cached)
```

### Build Process
1. **Root build**: `npm run build`
2. **Client build**: Builds React app to `client/dist/`
3. **Server**: Uses existing Express.js app
4. **Static serving**: Server serves client assets for frontend routes

### Deployment Flow
```
Vercel Deploy → Root package.json → Client Build → Server Function → Unified App
```

## Environment Variables Required
Set these in Vercel dashboard:
- `MONGODB_URI`
- `MONGODB_DATABASE`
- `MONGODB_COLLECTION`
- `MONGODB_OUT_COLLECTION`
- `MONGODB_AREACODES_COLLECTION`
- `MONGODB_USERS_COLLECTION`
- `NODE_ENV=production`

## Benefits of New Architecture

### ✅ Fixed Issues
- **Single domain**: No more CORS issues
- **Unified deployment**: One project to manage
- **Proper routing**: API and frontend routes work together
- **Static asset serving**: Optimized caching and delivery
- **Environment consistency**: Single environment configuration

### ✅ Performance Improvements
- **Asset optimization**: Proper chunking and caching
- **Build optimization**: Streamlined build process
- **Serverless functions**: 30s timeout for API endpoints
- **Static caching**: 1-year cache for assets, no cache for HTML

### ✅ Development Experience
- **Monorepo structure**: Easier to manage and deploy
- **Local development**: Both client and server can run together
- **Build scripts**: Coordinated build process
- **Documentation**: Complete deployment guides

## Deployment Instructions

### For New Deployment
1. Connect repository to Vercel
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

### For Migration from Separate Projects
1. Delete old separate Vercel projects
2. Deploy this monorepo as single project
3. Update any external references to new domain
4. Test all functionality

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Health check: `/health`
2. ✅ API endpoints: `/api/record-counts`
3. ✅ Frontend: `/` (React app loads)
4. ✅ Static assets: CSS, JS, images load correctly
5. ✅ SPA routing: All React routes work
6. ✅ API integration: Frontend can call backend APIs

## Testing Results
- ✅ Client build successful
- ✅ Assets properly organized (`/assets/css/`, `/assets/js/`)
- ✅ Static files in correct locations
- ✅ Server configuration updated for deployment paths
- ✅ Environment variables documented and templated

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel using new configuration
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Test all functionality in production
4. Update any external integrations to use new single domain
5. Monitor performance and logs

The deployment architecture is now properly configured for a unified Vercel deployment that will resolve the original API access issues.
